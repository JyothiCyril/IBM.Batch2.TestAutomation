ExtentReports
-------------

Java based API used along with selenium and testng for generating the crystal and maintain the test results post execution

* Selenium do not have an in-built mechanism to generate the test results
* TestNG reports generated gets appended on every test execution.

Open Source & Professional (Licensed)

1. Generate the HTML report
2. Pie graph
3. Dashboard for overall test summary
4. Add the screenshots to the html report, if the test is failed.
----------------------


Configure on How and Where the html report should be created. --> HtmlReporter
Loaded as ExtentReport --> Configure

----------------------------------------------------------------

Case Study:

1. Create NewTourLogin class that extends TestBase (To open browser, launch URL & Configure the properties file)
2. Launch URL https://demo.guru99.com/test/newtours/
3. Create credentials.properties file under com.qa.testdata folder and store username and password.username=mercury password=mercury
4. write the code in NewTourLogin class for Login functionality that can read the username and password from credentials.properties file
5. Check if the user login is successful

Run testng.xml file from pom.xml file Eclipse IDE or Apache Maven

Why to run testng.xml file from pom.xml?

Execution of test automation code will be triggered on the Jenkins platform where the devops engineer will pull the code while doing the CICD(continous integration and continuous deployment)

CICD is a technical agile : It is an automated approach for integrating the units and deploying the integrated build on different platfor.

Devops engineer will pipeline different tools for performing CICD activity.


** Equip the test automation project to be executed on the Jenkins platform

While the Jenkins platform will run the project in the Maven style.

Maven is a build management used by the developers for systematical build developement

Maven project is used by the QA while working with selenium to maintain the uniformity of creating the project while working with other colloborators/ team members.

pom.xml --> heart of maven project used to run the other test suite (testng.xml) file

Configure the required plug - in and API into pom.xml file to run testng.xml file.

Plugin - sure-fire plugin : is test plug in used to run the unit test using Junit.

we will the sure-fire plugin to trigger the test execution / test code that is using TestNG framework.
* To run the test code with the surefire plugin, the code should available only under src/test/java folder.
* we need the support of TestNG API should be configured into pom.xml file.
* Define the path of testng.xml file under configurations of sure-fire plugin.
* run the pom.xml file using maven commands. --> mvn test ( running the life till the src/test/java) or mvn clean test (the previous execution reports will be clean and run the test a fresh)

2. Execution phase : The code is executed against the application
		1. Run the test code individually
		2. Run the test code in the test suite (collection of test cases) --> testng.xml
		3. Run the test suite using apache maven as pom.xml (testng.xml file will be executed from pom.xml)
		4. Run the test suite on the CLI 
		5. Run the test suite from Jenkins (CICD tool)
